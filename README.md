# Website-practice
Practice website to teach the possibilities of HTML 
Below you will find the instructions on how to run this file.
Once youve downloaded the repository and have unziped the file locally to your desktop

in order to view the website. "RUN AS CHROME" or "RUN WITH CHROME"
^
this means right click the file named "index", click on "open with" and then click on any internet browser (Goodle Chrome, explorer, safari, ect)

In order to edit the code and actually make changes I suggest you "Open with visual studio code". you can use your notepad to view and make changes
however it will be very hard to properly indent and edit your code. I suggest you stick to a recomended code editor

I suggest Piecharm/ Pie chart/ VS code/ VS studio/ Thonny
